        Nikhita is a good girl and no one understands her importance because they are all
        blind so they can't see others goodness  but I believe on some day or the other she
        will reach the position what she is deserved for. Finally she wants to lead a normal
        life with all. She has some habits which sometimes increases others anger by saying
        facts to them so that they will hurt they scold her. This is not at all new to her because 
        it is daily routine process to her.
